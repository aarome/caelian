### Why so many templates?

The layout builder in Drupal 8/9 core is piping hot garbage. Display Suite is slightly less piping hot but comes with way too many "batteries" and a lot of them are either the wrong size or are DOA. Layout requirements are extremely simple and we certainly don't need the clunkiness/ dog-vomit-UX of layout builder nor the UI overhead of Display Suite. As for Panels....whatever.
